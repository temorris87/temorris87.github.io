## Current Projects

### <a href="/Projects/Astar">A\*</a>
C++ - Implementation of A* using euclidian distance for the heuristic function.
Design is reusable for many situations with two public methods available
for adding nodes and edges to the graph.

### <a href="/Projects/AlgorithmVisualization">Algorithm Visualization</a>
OOAD Java - An extendable object oriented framework for visualizing
different types of simulations. Examples used are sorting algorithms.

### <a href="/Projects/GameOfLife">Conway's Game of Life</a>
TDD Python - Two-dimensional simulation of Conway's Game of Life. 
Utilizes Pygame for graphics and demonstrates how to use test cases with Python's test framework for obtaining 100% code coverage.

### <a href="/Projects/RegisterAllocation">Register Allocation</a>
Scheme - Implementation of top down and bottom up register allocation
heuristics for the backend of a compiler. A comparison of how each of the
algorithms perform for different metrics is made.

### <a href="/Projects/InformationBoard">Information Board</a>
Java - Design and implementation of a distributed system that provides the
ability for easier communication with visitor's to Gosselin Funeral Home in
terms of services on the premises.
