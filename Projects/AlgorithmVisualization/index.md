## Algorithm Visualization Introduction

Algorithm Visualization is a program implemented in JavaFX that was created
to be an easily extendable program for visualizing various algorithms. The
program was developed using object oriented techniques for maximizing code
reuse. At the base of everything is a 2D canvas that can be used in
visualizing many things, not just algorithms. Therefore while this program
shows off its capabilities with algorithms, it can be extended to any
2D simulation that can be thought up.
