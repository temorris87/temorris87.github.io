## Introduction

Implementation of a Sudoku board. There are twenty random boards that can be played. While solving,
the player has the ability to take notes by switching modes with the 'n' key. When every cell is
filled, the game runs an algorithm to check if the board is solved. On a successful completion, the
player is notified and congratulated.
