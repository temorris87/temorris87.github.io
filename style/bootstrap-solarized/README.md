# bootstrap-solarized

A pair of CSS themes for [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) based
on Ethan Schoonover's
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).  Initially created
with
[bootstrap-magic](http://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic). They're
not 100% comprehensive, but they're good enough for my usage, and I'll
be updating them periodically as I run into corners I need to correct.

To use the color themes, load either `bootstrap-solarized-dark.css` or
`bootstrap-solarized-light.css` _after_ loading `bootstrap.css`.

This package is
[available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-solarized). To
install via npm:

```
npm install bootstrap-solarized
```

See it in real-world use providing
[color themes for Tessera](http://urbanairship.github.io/tessera/#themes).

## Demo

The `demo/` directory has a couple of small demo pages which generated
the screenshots below, and a copy of An Vo's
[bootstrap-tldr](https://github.com/anvoz/bootstrap-tldr), for seeing
all Bootstrap components in one page.
