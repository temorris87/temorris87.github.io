## Current Projects

### <a href="/Projects/AlgorithmVisualization>Algorithm Visualization</a>
An extendable object oriented framework in Java for visualizing different
types of simulations. Examples used are sorting algorithms.

### <a href="/Projects/GameOfLife>Conway's Game of Life</a>
Two-dimensional simulation of Conway's Game of Life in Python. Utilizes Pygame
for graphics and demonstrates how to use test cases with Python's test
framework for obtaining 100% code coverage.

### <a href="/Projects/RegisterAllocation"Register Allocation</a>
Implementation of top down and bottom up register allocation heuristics for
the backend of a compiler. A comparison of how each of the algorithms perform
for different metrics is made.

### <a href="/Projects/InformationBoard"Information Board</a>
Design and implementation of a distributed system that provides the ability
for easier communication with visitor's to Gosselin Funeral Home in terms of
services on the premises.
